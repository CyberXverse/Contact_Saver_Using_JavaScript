# Contact_Saver_Using_JavaScript

This is the contact saver i created using a javascript code that will store the data of your contacts and their images you saved there
the javascript i like  a database system that gives you access to save like 1billion contacts on your computer database

we had to combine the  the *SCRIPT FILE* with *HTML5* and *CSS3* to make the interface fast and smooth.


THIS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET YOUR CONTACT SAVED THERE

YOUR NAME
YOUR EMAIL
YOUR PHONE NUMBER
YOUR IMAGE LINK(it can be a link from your local disk or an image from a website that you copy the link of it and paste it there to get your mage over there)
